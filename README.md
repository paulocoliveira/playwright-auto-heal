## ‚ùìWhat is this Repository about?

- This repo contains example code for **How to Auto Heal Tests in Playwright**, demonstrating how to build resilient UI tests and reduce flakiness using Playwright‚Äôs smart locator features and LambdaTest‚Äôs Auto Heal capability.
- You‚Äôll find sample test scripts using semantic locators (getByRole, getByLabel, getByText) and a complete setup for running these tests both locally and in the LambdaTest cloud environment.

## ‚ùìMore about How to Auto Heal Tests in Playwright...
This tutorial explores techniques for building self-healing UI tests using Playwright. You‚Äôll learn how to handle dynamic components, implement retry strategies, and enable LambdaTest‚Äôs Auto Heal feature to automatically recover from locator failures. It's perfect for teams building automation in fast-changing UIs.

## Running the Code

To run any of the basic scripts from command line use the following command in the correct folder:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/register.spec.js
```
